# Introduction

For the final 2 weeks of CodeClan's professional software development course, we were tasked to build an open ended project consolidating everything learned over the 16 weeks. Due to the open endness nature of the project, I chose to learn C# and use the Unity engine to build a 2D platformer game. 

# Brief

2 week final project at CodeClan. 

<b> MVP </b>

- Create a 2D-Platformer game using Unity and C# in a time-frame of 2 weeks

- Single level to be achieved in 2 weeks

- Basic environment to add to story and design of game 

<b> Goal of the game </b>
